I am a fifth year graduate student at the [UIC MSCS department](https://mscs.uic.edu/). My advisor is [Wenliang Zhang](https://wlzhang.people.uic.edu/).

### Research Interests
I am broadly interested in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Specifically, I am interested in understanding local cohomology modules, D-modules and singularity problems in any characteristic. 

Recently I am trying to understand mixed Hodge structures on local cohomology modules.

#### My most recent [CV](cv.pdf).

#### Teaching
In Fall 2022 I am a grader of Math 435 (Introduction of number theory) and Math 310 (Applied linear algebra).

#### Papers

  - On the generalized multiplicities of maximal minors and sub-maximal pfaffians, [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09657), submitted.
  - Singularities of generic linkage via Frobenius powers, [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06380), submitted.
  - Socle degrees for local cohomology modules of thickenings of maximal minors and sub-maximal Pfaffians (with Michael Perlman), [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06899).
