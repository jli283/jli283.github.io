I am a fifth year graduate student at the [UIC MSCS department](https://mscs.uic.edu/). My advisor is [Wenliang Zhang](https://wlzhang.people.uic.edu/).

### Research Interests
I am broadly interested in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Currently my focus is on understanding local cohomology, D-modules and singularity problems in whatever characteristic. I am also interested in learning a bit of number theory.

#### Short CV 

  - **Education** 
    - PhD in Pure Mathematics, University of Illinois at Chicago, IL, 2018 - present;
    - BSc (Hons) in Mathematical Sciences, Binghamton University, NY, 2014 - 2017.
  - **Past Teaching**
    - Discussion sessions of Math 110 (College Algebra), Math 125 (Elementary Linear Algebra for Business) and Math 180 (Calculus I), Math 181 (Calculus II).
    - Grader for MATH 320 (Linear Algebra) and MATH 330 (Abstract Algebra).
  - **Service**
    - (2021-2022) Co-organized the grad student number theory seminar at UIC with [John Lee](https://mscs.uic.edu/profiles/slee649/).
