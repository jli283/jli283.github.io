I am a fourth year graduate student at the UIC MSCS department. My advisor is Wenliang Zhang.

### Research Interest
I am broadly interested in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Currently my focus is on understanding local cohomology and characterstic p method in CA/AG. I am also interested in learning a bit of number theory.

Previously my interest was in differential geometry.
