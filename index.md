I am currently a postdoc at the math department of the University of Oklahoma, my mentor is [András Cristian Lőrincz](https://math.ou.edu/~alorincz/).

In Summer 2024, I obtained my PhD in mathematics from the [math department of University of Illinois at Chicago](https://mscs.uic.edu/), where my advisor was [Wenliang Zhang](https://wlzhang.people.uic.edu/).

### Research Interests
I am broadly interested in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Specifically, I am interested in understanding local cohomology modules, D-modules and singularity problems in any characteristic. 

#### My most recent [CV](Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

#### Papers
  - Vanishing of Local cohomology and Segre products (with Wenliang Zhang), in preparation.
  - On the generalized multiplicities of maximal minors and sub-maximal pfaffians, [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09657), submitted.
  - Singularities of generic linkage via Frobenius powers, [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06380), accepted to Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.
  - Socle degrees for local cohomology modules of thickenings of maximal minors and sub-maximal Pfaffians (with [Michael Perlman](https://sites.google.com/view/michaelperlman/home?authuser=0)), [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06899), accepted to Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.
