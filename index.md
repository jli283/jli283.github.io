I am a fifth year graduate student at the [UIC MSCS department](https://mscs.uic.edu/). My advisor is [Wenliang Zhang](https://wlzhang.people.uic.edu/).

### Research Interests
I am broadly interested in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. My focus is on understanding local cohomology modules, D-modules and singularity problems in any characteristic. 

Recently I am trying to understand mixed Hodge structures on local cohomology modules.
